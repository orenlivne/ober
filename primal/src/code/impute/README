Introduction: What is Impute
============================

Impute phases and imputes a genotype data set for which pedigree is available.
1. Topic 1
2. Topic 2

Dependencies
============
These are easiest to install within a python virtualenv.
- See http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html for installing virtualenv and creating
  a virtual environment. Then install:
- nose
- PIL
- networkx 1.7+
- numpy 1.6.2+
- scipy 0.10.1+ (you may need to compile BLAS, LAPACK from sources. Make sure to compile with -fPIC)

Environment Variables
=====================
- OBER: directory containing the OBER svn tree
- TEST_DATA_DIR: directory containing test data files to run the test suite

Directories
===========
- batch: cluster batch bash scripts
  - batch/lethal: lethal mutation identification via lack of HBD children in at-risk families
  - batch/phasing: phasing and imputation pipeline
- db: database SQL scripts (database of IBD segments, SNP annotations)
- impute: python code - main package
- tests: python unit tests
