##  What machine is your central manager?

##  Pathnames:
##  Where have you installed the bin, sbin and lib condor directories?   

RELEASE_DIR = ~condor/condor-home


##  Where is the local condor directory for each host?  
##  This is where the local config file(s), logs and
##  spool/execute directories are located

##  Mail parameters:
##  When something goes wrong with condor at your site, who should get
##  the email?

CONDOR_ADMIN = root@$(CONDOR_HOST)


##  Full path to a mail delivery program that understands that "-s"
##  means you want to specify a subject:

MAIL = /usr/bin/mail


##  Network domain parameters:
##  Internet domain of machines sharing a common UID space.  If your
##  machines don't share a common UID space, set it to 
##  UID_DOMAIN = $(FULL_HOSTNAME)
##  to specify that each machine has its own UID space.

UID_DOMAIN = $(MY_IPADDRESS)


##  Internet domain of machines sharing a common file system.
##  If your machines don't use a network file system, set it to
##  FILESYSTEM_DOMAIN = $(FULL_HOSTNAME)
##  to specify that each machine has its own file system. 

FILESYSTEM_DOMAIN = $(MY_IPADDRESS)


##  The user/group ID <uid>.<gid> of the "Condor" user. 
##  (this can also be specified in the environment)
##  Note: the CONDOR_IDS setting is ignored on Win32 platforms

##  Condor needs to create a few lock files to synchronize access to
##  various log files.  Because of problems we've had with network
##  filesystems and file locking over the years, we HIGHLY recommend
##  that you put these lock files on a local partition on each
##  machine.  If you don't have your LOCAL_DIR on a local partition,
##  be sure to change this entry.  Whatever user (or group) condor is
##  running as needs to have write access to this directory.  If
##  you're not running as root, this is whatever user you started up
##  the condor_master as.  If you are running as root, and there's a
##  condor account, it's probably condor.  Otherwise, it's whatever
##  you've set in the CONDOR_IDS environment variable.  See the Admin
##  manual for details on this.

##  Java parameters:
##  If you would like this machine to be able to run Java jobs,
